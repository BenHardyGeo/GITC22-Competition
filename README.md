# GITC22-Competition
An attempt to build an open source well optimization planner
The link to the competition and the real code is here: https://github.com/GeoML-SIG/wildcatter
This repository is just my laughable attempt at the problem

There should be a video attempting the code here are the time stamps:
01:05 - After a brief intro, we describe how we got the multi well drilling to happen
03:27 - Talk about updates to the model to attempt to get it to drill the higher value locations
07:55 - Training the model in a new environment
